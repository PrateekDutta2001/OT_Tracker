# Backend Application README

## Overview

This is the backend for the web application project, which serves as the API layer for the frontend. It is built using Node.js and TypeScript, utilizing Express for handling HTTP requests and a database for data storage.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the backend application.
  - **controllers/**: Contains the controllers that handle API requests.
  - **models/**: Contains the data models for interacting with the database.
  - **routes/**: Contains the route definitions for the API.
  - **services/**: Contains the business logic and service layer.
  - **utils/**: Contains utility functions, including database connection logic.
  - **app.ts**: The entry point of the application.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd webapp-project/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory and add the necessary environment variables, such as database credentials.

4. **Run the application**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access the API**:
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Usage

Refer to the API documentation for details on available endpoints and their usage.

## Production Deployment

For deploying the application in a production environment, consider the following infrastructure requirements:

- A cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) or a dedicated server to host the application.
- Docker for containerization of the backend and frontend applications.
- Nginx as a reverse proxy to manage incoming requests and serve the frontend application.
- A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for data storage.
- Environment variables for sensitive configurations (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
- Monitoring and logging tools to track application performance and errors.
- A CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
