# Infrastructure Setup for Web Application Project

This document provides an overview of the infrastructure requirements and setup for deploying the web application project in a production environment.

## Infrastructure Requirements

1. **Cloud Service Provider or Dedicated Server**
   - Choose a cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) or a dedicated server to host the application.

2. **Containerization with Docker**
   - Use Docker to containerize both the backend and frontend applications. This ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies deployment.

3. **Nginx as a Reverse Proxy**
   - Configure Nginx to act as a reverse proxy. It will manage incoming requests and serve the frontend application, directing API calls to the backend.

4. **Database**
   - Select a suitable database for data storage:
     - Relational Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL
     - NoSQL Database: MongoDB

5. **Environment Variables**
   - Utilize environment variables to manage sensitive configurations such as database credentials and API keys. This enhances security and flexibility.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Implement monitoring and logging tools to track application performance and errors. This helps in maintaining the health of the application and troubleshooting issues.

7. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated testing and deployment. This streamlines the development process and ensures that changes are deployed reliably.

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Build Docker Images**
   - Navigate to the `infra/docker` directory and build the Docker images for both the backend and frontend applications using the provided Dockerfiles.

2. **Run Docker Compose**
   - Use the `docker-compose.yml` file in the `infra` directory to orchestrate the services. This file defines the necessary services, networks, and volumes for the application.

3. **Configure Nginx**
   - Update the `nginx.conf` file in the `infra/nginx` directory to set up the reverse proxy rules for the frontend and backend applications.

4. **Database Setup**
   - Initialize the database using the SQL commands in the `database/migrations/init.sql` file. Ensure that the database is accessible from the backend application.

5. **Environment Configuration**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store environment variables. Ensure that this file is not included in version control.

6. **Monitoring and Logging Setup**
   - Integrate monitoring and logging tools as per your choice (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack).

7. **CI/CD Configuration**
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI to automate testing and deployment processes.

By following these guidelines, you can successfully deploy the web application project in a production environment, ensuring scalability, security, and maintainability.
