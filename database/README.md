# Database Setup Documentation

This directory contains the necessary files and instructions for setting up and managing the database for the web application project.

## Migrations

The `migrations` folder includes SQL scripts that define the database schema and initial data. The primary file is `init.sql`, which contains the commands to create tables and seed the database with initial values.

### Running Migrations

To run the migrations, execute the following command in your database management tool or terminal:

```sql
-- Run the init.sql script to set up the database
\i path/to/init.sql
```

Make sure to replace `path/to/init.sql` with the actual path to the `init.sql` file.

## Database Configuration

Ensure that your database connection settings are correctly configured in the backend application. This typically includes:

- Database host
- Database name
- Database user
- Database password

These settings should be stored in environment variables for security.

## Production Environment

For deploying the application in a production environment, consider the following infrastructure requirements:

- Use a cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) or a dedicated server to host the database.
- Choose a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) based on your application needs.
- Implement monitoring and logging tools to track database performance and errors.
- Ensure that backups are regularly taken to prevent data loss.

For further details on the overall project setup, refer to the main `README.md` file located in the root of the project.
